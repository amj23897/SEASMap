# SEASMap - A small scale Google Maps prototype

SEASMap is an Android application providing shortest distance between two locations where GPS cannot give accurate results. The core algorithm implemented is Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. The user can create his/her own custom map by marking the nodes or navigate through the default map in the app, i.e. our college campus map.
